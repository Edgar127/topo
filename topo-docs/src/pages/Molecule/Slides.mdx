## Slides

You can use the Slideshow component to automatically transition between a bunch of photos or other elements. It takes:

- `duration` - The duration to show an image.
- `transitionDuration` - The duration the fade lasts between images.
- `resize` - The resizing method to use to normalize the image size, either `'cover'` or `'contain'`.
- (and, as always, all the normal Box props)

<Playground>
  <Slides width={256} height={256} duration={5}>
    <Image src="https://placekitten.com/256/256" />
    <Image src="https://picsum.photos/256/256" />
  </Slides>
</Playground>
