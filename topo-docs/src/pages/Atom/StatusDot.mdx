# Status Dot

Represents the status of a resource. Takes the following props:

- `size` -- The size, a number or string which could be passed to Box's `height` prop. Defaults to 3.
- `online`, `away`/`pending`, and `offline` -- Turns the status green, yellow, or red, respectively.

It is recommended that you also provide a tooltip for color-blindness accessibility.

<Playground>

    <StatusDot offline />
  </Box>
