# Divider

Our community should not be divided but our websites sometimes need to be. The divider component takes no props.

## Import

```js
import { Divider } from "@codeday/topo/Atom";
```

## Example

<Playground>
  <>
    <Box p={2}>here is some text</Box>
    <Divider />
    <Box p={2}>here is some more text</Box>
  </>
</Playground>

(Exciting I know.)
