# Image

This component draws a single image... however it also composes `<Box />`, so we can do neat boxy things like round
the corners:

## Import

```js
import { Image } from "@codeday/topo/Atom";
```

## Example

<Playground>
  <Image src="https://placekitten.com/256/256" borderRadius="full" />
</Playground>
