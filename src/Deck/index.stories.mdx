# Deck

Used to show a PDF slide deck.

Takes the following props:

- `src` - The PDF file to load. (Only PDFs are supported.)
- `allowDownload` - If set, the user can download the file.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Deck">
    <Deck src="https://f1.srnd.org/topo/stylebook/bad-ppt.pdf" allowDownload />
  </Story>
</Preview>

(No matter whether `allowDownload` is set or not, this is not a secure way to prevent people from downloading a PDF.
The PDF _will_ be downloadable.)
