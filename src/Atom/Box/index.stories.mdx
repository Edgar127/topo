# Box

Don't think out of the box, because pretty much everything is a box in Topo.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Standard Everyday Box">
    <Box>I am a box.</Box>
  </Story>
</Preview>

Boxes can actually be everything else, if you want, by setting `as` to the name of an html element:

<Preview>
  <Story name="The as prop">
    <Box as="a" href="http://example.com/" target="_blank">I am a box... a?</Box>
  </Story>
</Preview>

(Note that when you make a box something else, it keeps the formatting of a standard box. Most of the time you should
use another display component.)

## Boxes Have Props

It's a good thing that everything's a box, because all boxes take a ton of standard options, like:

- `bg` (aka `backgroundColor`)
- `w` (aka `width`)
- `p` (aka `padding`)
- `color`
- `rounded`
- `grad`
- [a bunch more](https://styled-system.com/api)

All these properties can use shorthand from the theme. For example, `color` could be set to `red.500`. That makes
it super easy to make useful boxes with minimal code:

<Preview>
  <Story name="Fancy Box">
    <Box grad="taffy.60" color="green.700" p={8} rounded="full">i Am ThE PaRtY bOx</Box>
  </Story>
</Preview>

(Or not-so-useful boxes, if you're so inclined.)
