# Box

Don't think out of the box, because pretty much everything is a box in Topo.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Standard Everyday Box">
    <Box>I am a box.</Box>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Boxes Have Props

It's a good thing that everything's a box, because all boxes take all the standard Styled System props. (See the
documentation page on Styled System for more info.)

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Fancy Box">
    <Box grad="taffy.60" color="green.700" p={8} rounded="full">i Am ThE PaRtY bOx</Box>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Boxes Can Be Anything

Boxes can actually render as any HTML element (or other React component) you prefer. Simply set `as` to the component
you'd like to register:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Box As">
    <Box as="a" href="http://example.com/" target="_blank">I am a box... <Code>&lt;a /&gt;</Code>?</Box>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Note that everything is CSS-reset, so when you make a box something else, it retains a complete lack of formatting.
Usually you'll want to use another component directly. (This can be useful in components that compose Box, however.
For example you could set `as={GatsbyLink}` on a `Link` component.)


## More Helpful Boxes

- The `Size` box has handlers for content size changes: `onWidthChanged`, `onHeightChanged`, and `onSizeChanged`.
- The `GridBox` takes `templateColumns`/`templateRows` props and sets up a grid.
