# Cognito Forms

Cognito Forms is our form provider of choice, and this component will let you quickly embed a hosted form!

- You can pass in `showTitle` if you'd like to show the form title, which is hidden by default.
- You can prefill forms by passing a `prefill` prop with `key: value` pairs for each field you want to fill.

<Preview>
  <Story name="CognitoForm">
    <CognitoForm id={61} showTitle={false} />
  </Story>
</Preview>
