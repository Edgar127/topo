# Cognito Forms

Cognito Forms is our form provider of choice, and this component will let you quickly embed a hosted form! It takes the
following props:

- `showTitle`: Shows the built-in form title. (Default is to hide it.)
- `prefill`: Object (of `{FieldName: value, FieldName: value}`) to prefill the form with.
- `onSubmit`: Function to run when the form is submitted.
- `onPageChange`: Function to run when the page changes.
- `onFirstPageChange`: Function to run on the first page change (analytics signal that the user has started the form).
