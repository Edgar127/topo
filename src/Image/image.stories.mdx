# Image

This component draws a single image... however it also composes `<Box />`, so we can do neat boxy things like round
the corners:

<Preview>
  <Story name="Image">
    <Image src="https://placekitten.com/256/256" borderRadius="full" />
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Slideshow

You can use the Slideshow component to automatically transition between a bunch of photos. It takes:

- `srcs` - An array of sources for the images.
- `duration` - The duration to show an image.
- `transitionDuration` - The duration the fade lasts between images.
- `resize` - The resizing method to use to normalize the image size, either `'cover'` or `'contain'`.
- (and, as always, all the normal Box props)

<Preview>
  <Story name="Slideshow">
    <Slideshow
      width={256}
      height={256}
      duration={5}
      srcs={['https://placekitten.com/256/256', 'https://picsum.photos/256/256']}
    >Hi there</Slideshow>
  </Story>
</Preview>
